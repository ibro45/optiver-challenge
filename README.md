## Inspiration
We were excited to learn that there is a company trying to make green assets more accessible and liquid for all traders. We were also very motivated to learn about making markets, trading strategies and how we could apply our Software Engineering skills to create a bot that trades.

## What it does
It uses a simple strategy that tries to find small opportunities in the illiquid market and make a small profit. It works-ish!

## How we built it
We built it using tools provided by us by Optibook, which included:

AWS, Python, Optibook trading client We applied a grid trading strategy while hedging our trades so we minimize the loss but still have profits and entice liquidity in the market.
Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was that we had no trading experience, this meant first we had to educate ourselves what are ETF, how does hedging works, how to trade stocks, what are trading strategies, how to make a simple trade.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
From almost none knowledge in trading we managed to made a bot that would increase the attractiveness of green stocks while at the same time increased the profitability and attractiveness of the stocks.

## What we learned
We learned how hedging and stocks work. Also how to apply some basic trading strategies (Grid trading) to minimize loss risk while at the same time still make profit and increase stock liquidity (ability to trade stocks at a specific prices almost instantly)

## What's next for Zeleno brdo
We would like to further learn and improve our algorithm so we could apply it to real world green trading stocks to see how it fares :)
